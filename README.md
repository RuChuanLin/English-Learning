# English-Learning

**This is a brand-new start for me to improve my English skill.**

I create this repo to record my learning materials and methods, and to integrate all of them as well. I also make this repo public so that I will have stronger motivation to update it. ðŸ˜‚

## [Everything starts from this video.](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Gt411S72A?p=1)

## English learning is an unconcious knowledge.

I have played badminton for 2 - 3 years, there are many skills and rules to follow, for winning a game.

Almost every skill can be found on Internet, and there are so many 'literal' explanation for support learning it. However, even I have read lots of which, I still play not very well on this sport.

The reason is that **I can not learn badminton just by reading the knowledge, I have to keep practicing it.**

BUT why I have to keep practicing badminton, or other sports? and I don't have to KEEP practicing like hard programing problem, so that I can solve it very smoothly?

The crucial difference between playing badminton and solving problem is that, I have plenty of time to solve hard problems, it can be 1 hour or later, and I don't need the whole process to be very coherent.

Badminton, however, rqeuires me to connect every movement very quickly. So instead of thinking what the next step I have to act, I have to make it a reflex action, that is why I have to practice it, and this is so-called **unconcious knowledge**, or implicit knowledge.

Most sports, languages, and musical instruments are unconcious knowledge.

## How to Practice unconcious knowledge?

**Define the only 2 important things: input and output**

There are 4 English skills: reading, listening, writing, speaking.

The first step is to decide which skills to improve.

Then to use lots of example to **reshape the connections in brain**

For example, for listening:

- Input:  the audio of a word, a sentence, or a paragraph.
- Output: the meaning in mind.

Most of us listen to the English material, and reading the subtitle at the meantime, **this is ALL WRONG**. Because we will learn different kind of knowledge. The input will be voice and subtitles, so it will be no use when there is no subtitles.

Another common mistake is that we listen to English without knowing the meaning. This is **without output.**

Input and output are both crucial, which need to be aware of at all time.

## The ways to practice English, the unconcious knowledge.

### 2 principles:

1. Explicit input and output
2. Reshaping brain by examples

### 8 steps:

1. Read the **English explanation** of a word.
2. Read sentences to **feel** the meaning.
3. Choose simple sentences.
4. Read the sentence and thinking the scenes.
5. 

#### 1. Read the English explanation of a word.

Choose a unknown word and read its English explanation.
```
Appreciate

If you appreciate something, for example, a piece of music or good food, you like it because you recognize its good qualities.
```

You probably not know the meaning of the word, so the next step is to read more examples.

#### 2. More Examples of the word, to **feel** it

```
There's no point buying him expensive wines.
He doesn't appreciate them.

Anyone can appreciate our music.
```

#### 3. Choose one of those sentences, the simpler the better

```
Anyone can appreciate our music.
```

#### 4. To imagine the scenes of the sentence.

This is for practicing reading.

**Note: at this point, don't read it out, otherwise the input will become speaking**. It will cause you will not know the meaning except you read it out.

#### 5. Express it by typing.

Type it and send to someone(?).

#### 6. Listening

type it to the Google Translate and listen it, and imagine the scenes as well.

#### 7. Express it by speaking.

Imagine the scenes, feel it and speak it out.

#### 8. Amend some words of the sentence, and repeat above steps.

```
Hopefully anyone can appreciate this video.
```

This is for expanding the basic material.

### Note

1. Do not be concious

Before practicing, you can think what to do and decide your sentence. But once you start reading / listening / speaking, Instead of thinking it conciously, you have to **feel** it unconciously.

Thinking in Chinese is strictly prohibited.

**THINKING IS SLOW, FEELING IS FAST.**

2. Practice with sentences

One word may have different meaning with different context. So senctice is the smallest unit to practice.

3. Multiple sentences.

4. Output is coherent.
